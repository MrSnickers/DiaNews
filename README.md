# DiaNews

This is a little jQuery powered site to give you the news.

## Quick start

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Open the `index.html` file in your preferred (modern) browser.


### Notes

This small project is written in ES6 and not pollyfilled, so it will not work in IE.

The part that does work is the news API provided by the folks at https://newsapi.org/
